    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>I am a Cloud / Software Engineer Apprentice currently enrolled in the Multiverse / Verizon Apprenticeship program. I am performing the <br />
        duties of a Platform Operator in DevOps. I monitor and verify the internet services internally and those of Verizon business customers, <br />
        making sure they are up and running as expected. My job respobsibilities allow me the hands on experience of working with Cloud computing<br />
        which is my area of career interest.  The Team I am working with NDR (Network Detection Response) security team consist of two groups, <br />
        Developers and Operations which I am excited about having this opportunity to work with both groups.</p>

<h2>Accomplishment 1:</h2>

<h2>Historical Black Colleges and Universities</h2>
<p>This project provides a streamline method for scholars to look up HBCUs and schedule campus visits as well as compare statistical data<br />
between colleges and universities.  This was a group project were the task were divided amongst the group and we assisted each other in our task.<br />
My task was to find the content (photos, charts) and create the README.md. We continued to work on this project after giving our class presentation<br />
with the intent to add enhancements such as building out the front-end with login/signin authorization and adding a link for accessibility instructions <br />
just to name a few enhancements. This is still a work in progress.<br /><br />

 <b>The Technologies used to create this project were:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>JavaScript - Client side and sever side application that allows web pages to be interactive</li>

 <li>HTML - Hypertext Mark Up language that give structure to Web pages</li>

 <li>CSS - Use for the style and presentation of the webpage</li>

 <li>Sequealize - allows you to connect to a database and perform operations with out writing SQL queries</li>

 <li>SQLite 3 - is embedded SQL database engine that reads and writes directly to ordinary files an used in all mobile phones and most computers</li>

 <li>Express - node js application framework used to build single, multipage and hybrid web application. Helps manage servers and routes</li>

 <li>Basic Auth - Sends user names and passwords over the Internet as text that is Base64 encoded and the target server is not authenticated</li>

 <li>OAuth - Uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers</li>

 <li>JWTs - Json Web Token compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties because it is verified and digitally signed.</li>

    My interest in technology began when I worked as a computer operator for the cable company. <br />
    I saw an opportunity to learn the software and hardware sides of computers and went on to earn <br />
    my Associates and Bachelor degrees in Computer Science.<br />
    Due to Covid, technology has been pushed ahead at a rapid pace of development. Opportunities<br />
    have become available, such as System Security and Cloud Computing, creating a need for these<br />
    technical skills immediately. I am currently enrolled in Multiverse Cloud / Software Engineering<br />
    Apprenticeship program preparing me to take on DevSecOps duties.

    I am working with Verizon NDR (Network Detection and Response) group. NDR (formely ProtectWise) is a startup company acquired<br />
    by Verizon in March, 2019. ProtectWise positioned itself as a provider of a cloud Network DVR -"virtual camera in the cloud that<br />
    records everything on the network." It is a platform for managing and securing enterprise, cloud, hybrid and industrial control <br />
    systems (ICS) environments. Verizon feels that integrating ProtectWise capabilities with it's leading global network services further<br />
    enhances their abilities to detect and respond to security threats.<br />

    <b>NDR</b> is broken into two groups:<br />
    <b>- DEVELOPERS</b> - working with Terraform and Kubernetes<br />
    <b>- PLATFORM OPERATORS</b> - My duties as a Platform Operator are: Performing routine maintenance on Cassandra nodes (bringing them back online),<br />
    migrating off retired Cassandra nodes.<br />
    Performing security related maintenance on Spinnaker deploying applications via redeployment.<br />
    Performing security related maintenance on non-Spinnaker deployed applications (patching via Ansible).<br />
    Creating and maintaing Documentation of Operations policies and proedures (contributing to the RunBook and other procedure documentation).</p>
