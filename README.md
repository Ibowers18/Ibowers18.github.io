# My Journal Journey as a Verizon Apprentice

I am starting this Journal Journey 2 months into my Cloud Practitioner Verizon / Multiverse Apprenticeship.  My expectations were learning Cloud computing and programming. I was not sure what type of programming I would be learning and anyone I asked could not give me a definite answer being this is a new startup program.  I was told that I would be taught whatever programming I would need to learn.  So, I assumed the first 5 weeks with Multiverse I would learn 1 or 2 programming languages and once I started training on the job with Verizon, I would get the opportunity to practice more programming. My training schedule is split between Multiverse (4 – 2 weeks modules learning programming and technical skills) and Verizon (shadowing and participating in performing task that my Security team is responsible for, Quality Assurance testing and Network Detection Responses). 

I should have paid closer attention to the name of the Bootcamp” Flying Start”. Below are the learning objectives
that were taught in 5 weeks:
-	JavaScript
-	HTML
-	TTD (Test Driven Development)
-	OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
-	OOAD (Object Oriented Analysis and Design)
-	UML (Unified Modeling Language)
-	SQL
-	SQLite (Simple Database)
-	ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
-	RESTful design pattern
-	APIs (Application Programming Interface)
-	Node.js Express middleware
-	Web Accessibility
-	WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
-	HTML DOM
-	DOM (Document Object Model)

I hit the ground running, learning at the level of a junior programmer. I on the other hand felt like I was always running to catch up.  I was introduced to this over whelming amount of building block information in a short period of time and not given a chance to digest, understand or practice it other than the day it was presented.

I am now with my Verizon Security team participating in Quality Assurance and DevOps task.  I have been tasked to reflect on and track my daily 8 work hour accomplishments for the next 3 weeks starting 1/26/2022.

I have found by working from home I work more hours because I have less interruptions and no commute time to deal with.  This has caused me other problems because I am sitting for longer periods of time. I have gained weight have swollen feet and legs from not getting up, moving around or taking breaks. 
I am trying out different daily work routines:

-	Working out in the morning or evening
-	Walking before or after work
-	Setting my phone alarm for various times to remind me to take breaks
-	Eating healthy (fruits, prepared meals) vs easy snacking (fast foods, chips, jellybeans)

I have been studying for my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Certification since the beginning of Jan 2022.  I have completed the 28-hour online Pluralsight course offered by Verizon.  I am using Digital Cloud and AWSBoy for my exam study and training questions. The practice exams are scheduled for 2 hours and 10 minutes. My goal is to complete the exams with 100% score.  I am completing the exams, but my scores are averaging 78% (72% is passing). When I sit for this exam, I want to be able to know the answer to the question and verify it by reading the answer choices. I have been trying to take 4 exams a day, but I have been researching the questions I am getting wrong, so I am doing 2 to 3 exams a day and this includes retaking the exams.  There are 6 Practice exams, 6 Training exams and 10 knowledge base exams.

I wanted to sit for the exam by Jan 31 before the Multiverse Module 1 begins. I have pushing myself to put in 12+ hours studying, and this is not working health wise or study wise.  Per my coach we will be studying React during Module 1, so I want to get a head start on learning what Module 1 is about.  Having gone thru this task of reflection and tracking, I am going to take at least one AWS Solution Architect exam daily and turn my attention to React in Multiverse Module 1. I will plan on sitting for AWS SSA exam the third week of February.

My end Goal is to become a very knowledgeable and valued employee for myself and Verizon. I want to be an asset and be able to make a positive difference. I see Cloud computing as the future, and I want to learn as much as I can about it.

Covid-19 has changed all of our lives. Technology has been pushed ahead and we now have to learn how to use it.  Even the method of how we learn the training needed has changed.  Multiverse is looking to replace the 4-year college training for Tech jobs by offering these apprenticeship programs to corporations.  I feel the courses should be more streamlined and tailored to the positions that the apprentice is being trained for. 


Sample Study Journal:

1/26/2022 
- Yesterday -(1/25/2022) I took 3 AWS practice exams and studied the questions I missed. Each exam takes 2 hours and 10 minutes and I spend at least at least 4 hours retaking exams or researching missed questions.
- Today - I had an hour and a half, one on one meeting regarding this task of tracking my 8-hour workday and my success. I took one AWS SAA exam (89%).  I spent about 2 hours writing the format for my journal journey and 4 hours researching sources to learn React (Free Code Camp, Udemy and W3 school).

1/27/2022
- Yesterday (see Today above)
- Today – Attended the TSD All Hands Meeting Q1-2022 for one hour. Took one AWS SAA exam 130 minutes (88%). Worked with my internet provider on my unstable connection and set up my wireless extender 2 hours. Watched video on JavaScript and React for 3 hours.

1/28/2022
- Yesterday (see Today above)
- Today - Studied React, JavaScript Coding Videos (Pluralsight, Udemy) and Hands on coding (Free Code Camp) 8 hours

1/29/2022
- Yesterday (see Today above)
- Today – Took 2 AWS SAA exam (75% & 95%). Studied React and JavaScript for 4 hours
1/30/2022
- Yesterday (see Today above)
- Today - (Studied React and JavaScript for 4 hours)

1/31/2022
- Yesterday (see Today above)
- Today – Started Module One of Multiverse – designing, building and optimizing a front- end UI for users mobile/ desktop (8 hours).  I also plan on taking at least one AWS SAA practice exam today

I sat for and passed my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Certification exam on March 5, 2022.  I have decided that I want to do DevSecOps , so my next certification will be AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate with the projected testing date of December 2022 followed by the AWS Certified Security Specialty certification.

- Months 3 and 4 involved workshops focusing on designing, building and optimizing UX, Web accessibility and performance considerations.

- Months 5 through 8 was the Growth Phase where I had to build and expand on the RESTful concepts from the 5-week bootcamp.

-	HTTP/HTTPS
-	RESTful API best practices
-	Building out RESTful API
-	Securing an API using Basic Auth
-	Securing an API with OAuth

Finally, some Cloud content, I was able to practice CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using tools such as Docker, Heroku and AWS CI/CD.

- Months 9 through 12 is the Execution phase where my security training was from the prospective of a hacker.  This training was done on OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Juice Shop, an insecure web application. Solve the hacking challenges of the hacker and score points on the scoreboard.
I am now in month 10 preparing for my final assessment which involves creating my portfolio and having a mock interview.

Although my initial perception and expectation of my apprenticeship was different than the reality of it, I feel I have gained valuable technical and programming skills. I have gained experience collaborating and working with various teams and taking on the roll as scrum master.  I have taken on task that I knew nothing about such as creating GitHub, Readme.md in HTML, CSS creating my portfolio and publishing it on GitHub using HTML, CSS.  I participated in a team project that took an assignment of creating a website that allows scholars to login into the website and schedule HBCU (Historical Black College and University) campus tours as well as compare the cost, courses offered, majors etc. of various other HBCUs. I created the accessibility section and the provided the data for links for the HBCU campus tours.  I did not get the Cloud experience I envisioned, but I was able to acquire my AWS Solution Architect Associate certification.
