    <p><b> My Journal Journey as a Verizon Apprentice</b></p>
    
   <p> <b>I am starting this Journal Journey 2 months into my Cloud Practitioner Verizon / Multiverse Apprenticeship.</b>  My expectations were learning <br />
    Cloud computing and programming. I was not sure what type of programming I would be learning and anyone I asked could not give me a<br />
    definite answer being this is a new startup program.  I was told that I would be taught whatever programming I would need to learn.  So, I<br /> 
    assumed the first 5 weeks with Multiverse I would learn 1 or 2 programming languages and once I started training on the job with Verizon, I <br />
    would get the opportunity to practice more programming. My training schedule is split between Multiverse (4 – 2 weeks modules learning<br />
    programming and technical skills) and Verizon (shadowing and participating in performing task that my Security team is responsible for,<br />
    Quality Assurance testing and Network Detection Responses).</p>

    <p>I should have paid closer attention to the name of the Bootcamp” Flying Start”. Below are the learning objectives <br />
    that were taught in 5 weeks:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>TTD (Test Driven Development)</li>
    <li>	OOP (Object Oriented Programming)</li>
    <li>	OOAD (Object Oriented Analysis and Design)</li>
    <li>	UML (Unified Modeling Language)</li>
    <li>	SQL</li>
    <li>	SQLite (Simple Database)</li>
    <li>	ORM (Object Relational Mapping)</li>
    <li>	RESTful design pattern</li>
    <li>	APIs (Application Programming Interface)</li>
    <li>	Node.js Express middleware</li>
    <li>	Web Accessibility</li>
    <li>	WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)</li>
    <li>	HTML DOM</li>
    <li>	DOM (Document Object Model)</li>
   </ul>

    <p>I hit the ground running, learning at the level of a junior programmer. I on the other hand felt like I was always running to catch up. I was<br />
    introduced to this over whelming amount of building block information in a short period of time and not given a chance to digest,<br />
    understand or practice it other than the day it was presented.</p>
    
    <p>I am now with my Verizon Security team participating in Quality Assurance and DevOps task.  I have been tasked, by my Verizon manager to reflect <br />
    on and track my daily 8 work hour accomplishments for the next 3 weeks starting 1/26/2022.</p>
    
    
    <p>I have found by working from home I work more hours because I have less interruptions and no commute time to deal with.  This has caused<br />
    me other problems because I am sitting for longer periods of time. I have gained weight have swollen feet and legs from not getting up, moving <br />
    around or taking breaks. I am trying out different daily work routines:</p>

   <ul>     
    <li>	Working out in the morning or evening</li>
    <li>	Walking before or after work</li>
    <li>	Setting my phone alarm for various times to remind me to take breaks</li>
    <li>	Eating healthy (fruits, prepared meals) vs easy snacking (fast foods, chips, jellybeans)</li>
   </ul>
       
    <p>I have been studying for my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Certification since the beginning of Jan 2022.  I have completed the<br />
     28-hour online Pluralsight course offered by Verizon.  I am using Digital Cloud and AWSBoy for my exam study and training questions. The<br />
     practice exams are scheduled for 2 hours and 10 minutes. My goal is to complete the exams with 100% score.  I am completing the exams,<br />
     but my scores are averaging 78% (72% is passing). When I sit for this exam, I want to be able to know the answer to the question and verify<br />
     it by reading the answer choices. I have been trying to take 4 exams a day, but I have been researching the questions I am getting wrong, so<br />
     I am doing 2 to 3 exams a day and this includes retaking the exams.  There are 6 Practice exams, 6 Training exams and 10 knowledge base exams.</p>
    
     <p>I wanted to sit for the exam by Jan 31 before the Multiverse Module 1 begins. I have pushing myself to put in 12+ hours studying, and this is<br />
     not working health wise or study wise.  Per my coach we will be studying React during Module 1, so I want to get a head start on learning<br />
     what Module 1 is about.  Having gone thru this task of reflection and tracking, I am going to take at least one AWS Solution Architect exam<br />
     daily and turn my attention to React in Multiverse Module 1. I will plan on sitting for AWS SSA exam the third week of February.</p>
    
     <p> My end Goal is to become a very knowledgeable and valued employee for myself and Verizon. I want to be an asset and be able to make a<br />
     positive difference. I see Cloud computing as the future, and I want to learn as much as I can about it.</p>
    
     <p>Covid-19 has changed all of our lives. Technology has been pushed ahead and we now have to learn how to use it.  Even the method of how <br />
     we learn the training needed has changed.  Multiverse is looking to replace the 4-year college training for Tech jobs by offering these<br />
     apprenticeship programs to corporations.  I feel the courses should be more streamlined and tailored to the positions that the apprentice is<br />
     being trained for.</p>

     <b><p>Sample Study Journal:</p></b>
    
    1/26/2022<br /><br />
       <li>Yesterday - (1/25/2022) I took 3 AWS practice exams and studied the questions I missed. Each exam takes 2 hours and 10 minutes and I<br />
          spend at least 4 hours retaking exams or researching missed questions.<br /></li>
       <li>Today - I had an hour and a half, one on one meeting with my Verizon manager regarding this task of tracking my 8-hour workday and my success.<br />
          I took one AWS SAA exam (89%).  I spent about 2 hours writing the format for my journal journey an 4 hours researching sources to learn React<br />
          coding using (Free Code Camp,Udemy and W3 school).</li> <br />
    1/27/2022<br /><br />

    <li> Yesterday (see Today above)<br />
    <li> Today - Took 2 AWS SAA exam (75% & 95%). Studied React and JavaScript for 4 hours.</li><br />

    1/30/2022<br /><br />
    <li> Yesterday (see Today above)<br />    
    <li> Today - (Studied React and JavaScript for 4 hours)</li><br />
    
    1/31/2022<br /><br />
    <li> Yesterday (see Today above)<br /> 
    <li> Today - Started Module One of Multiverse - designing, building and optimizing a front- end UI for users mobile/ desktop (8 hours).  I<br />
     also plan on taking at least one AWS SAA practice exam today.</li><br />
    
    <p>I sat for and passed my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Certification exam on March 5, 2022.  I have decided that I want to do<br />
       DevSecOps , so my next certification will be AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate with the projected testing date of December<br />
       2022 followed by the AWS Certified Security Specialty certification.</p>
    
    <p><b>- Months 3 and 4 involved workshops focusing on designing, building and optimizing UX, Web accessibility and performance considerations.</b></p>
    
    <p><b>- Months 5 through 8 was the Growth Phase where I had to build and expand on the RESTful concepts from the 5-week bootcamp.</b></p>
    
    <li>	HTTP/HTTPS<br />
    <li>	RESTful API best practices<br />
    <li>	Building out RESTful API<br />
    <li>	Securing an API using Basic Auth<br />
    <li>	Securing an API with OAuth<br />
    
    <p> Finally, some Cloud content, I was able to practice CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using tools such as Docker, <br />
        Heroku and AWS CI/CD.</p>
    
    <p><b>- Months 9 through 12 is the Execution phase where my security training was from the prospective of a hacker.</b>  This training was done on<br />
         OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Juice Shop, an insecure training web application. Solve the hacking challenges of the hacker <br />
         and score points on the scoreboard.  <b>I am now in month 10 preparing for my final assessment which involves creating my portfolio and having<br />
         a mock interview.</b></p>
    
    <p>Although my initial perception and expectation of my apprenticeship was different than the reality of it, I feel I have gained knowledge of programming <br />
       skills as well as technical and soft skills. I have gained experience collaborating and working with various teams and taking on the roll as scrum master. <br />
       I have taken on task that I knew nothing about such as creating GitHub, Readme.md in HTML, CSS creating my portfolio and publishing it on GitHub using<br />
       HTML, CSS.  I participated in a team project that took an assignment of creating a website that allows scholars to login into the website and schedule<br />
       HBCU (Historical Black College and University) campus tours as well as compare the cost, courses offered, majors etc. of various other HBCUs. I created <br />
       the accessibility section and the provided the data for links for the HBCU campus tours.  I did not get the Cloud experience I envisioned, but I was able<br />
       to acquire my AWS Solution Architect Associate certification.</p>
