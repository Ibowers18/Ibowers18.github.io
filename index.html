									<p>My interest in technology began when I worked as a computer operator for the cable company. <br />
									   I saw an opportunity to learn the software and hardware sides of computers and went on to earn <br />
									   my Associates and Bachelor degrees in Computer Science.<br />
									   Due to Covid, technology has been pushed ahead at a rapid pace of development. Opportunities<br />
									   have become available, such as System Security and Cloud Computing, creating a need for these<br />
									   technical skills immediately. I am currently enrolled in Multiverse Cloud / Software Engineering<br />
									   Apprenticeship program preparing me to take on DevSecOps duties.
										
									   I am working with Verizon NDR (Network Detection and Response) group. NDR (formely ProtectWise) is a startup company acquired<br />
									   by Verizon in March, 2019. ProtectWise positioned itself as a provider of a cloud Network DVR -"virtual camera in the cloud that<br />
									   records everything on the network." It is a platform for managing and securing enterprise, cloud, hybrid and industrial control <br />
									   systems (ICS) environments. Verizon feels that integrating ProtectWise capabilities with it's leading global network services further<br />
									   enhances their abilities to detect and respond to security threats.<br />

									   NDR is broken into two groups:<br />
									   - DEVELOPERS - working with Terraform and Kubernetes<br />
									   - PLATFORM OPERATORS - My duties as a Platform Operator are: Performing routine maintenance on Cassandra nodes (bringing them back online),<br />
									   migrating off retired Cassandra nodes.<br />
									   Performing security related maintenance on Spinnaker deploying applications via redeployment.<br />
									   Performing security related maintenance on non-Spinnaker deployed applications (patching via Ansible).<br />
									   Creating and maintaing Documentation of Operations policies and proedures (contributing to the RunBook and other procedure documentation).</p>
